cfc_analysis
============

Detailed quantitative and statistical  characterization of cross frequency coupling in neural data.

1) Computes the Modulation Index (Tort et al 2010) and weighted Phase Locking Factor (Maris et al 2011), and associated statistical significance.
2) determines preferred low-frequency phase of high-frequency amplitude coupling
3) determines anatomical distributions of coupling phase and amplitude LFPs
4)
